      <h1 class="title">Southern Resident Orca</h1>

        <p>The Southern Resident Orca are immensely social animals and true apex predators of the oceans around the globe. These Residents live in matriarchal society meaning the tracing of kinship is found through the female line. They live almost exclusively in the Salish Sea and are an ancient symbol and modern icon of the Pacific Coast. These orca hold an immensely cultural significance to Indigenous people along the coast.</p>

  <h2> The Orca Project </h2>
    <p>The idea behind this project was born to address the lack of information surrounding the <em><strong>critically endangered</strong></em> Southern Resident Orca population. The population of 74 orca has experienced a significant drop in numbers over the last decade, and these next few years will ultimately determine if they can stabilize enough to survive or continue toward extinction. Our purpose is to help you, help them. </p>

  <h3>How You Can Help </h1>
    <p>With your help, we can take the steps to work together to ensure these ancient family lines live on for future generations to be able to appreciate and respect as we do.</p>

  <h3> Our Resident Orcas</h3>
    <p>Let’s learn about what makes the remaining Southern Resident Orcas truly unique creatures of our oceans</p>
</div>

<div class = "stylesection">
  <h3> Uniquely WestCoast</h3>
  <p>The Southern Resident Orcas are highly intelligent apex predators of the Salish sea. Much like us, these iconic coastal creatures have an incredibly complex social structure dating back millennia. This large extended family or clan of whales is comprised of three pods: J, K, and L pods. These unique pods spend the majority of their time in the waters along British Columbia and Washington State.

<h4>Orca Facts</h4>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Orca society lives by a matriarchal society.</li>
<li>In the wild, killer whales can live between 50 and 80 years. One female in Pugent Sound, known as Granny, was estimated to have been born in 1911 and was still leading her   pod at 95 years of age in 2006.</li>
<li>Can you spot the difference between a resident and transient orca? Likely not but seals can. They’ve been documented swimming beside the residents and straight up ignoring the residents while sharing their waters.</li>
<li>Residents and transients speak in unique dialects, arguably described as different languages.</li>
<li>Seals can distinguish between the two and have been observed swimming next to fish-eating residents but will stay well clear, and will likely be quick out of the water, when they hear the mammal-eating transients.</li>
<li>Each of the three pods have their own dialects with unique calls in terms of the pattern, pitch and the numbers used.</li>
<li>Resident pods have the most established society known among the mammal kingdom.</li>
<li>Pods remain unaltered except for deaths and births.</li>
<li>A pod is made of up to four generations: great grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers and sisters and their offspring, including mature males.</li>
<li>There has only been one documented account of a wild orca attacking a human being: an orca once clutched a surfer but quickly realized his mistake and let go.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Industry Impact</h4>
<p>The pods are facing three major threats to survival: toxins, ship traffic and a lack of food and more specifically, Chinook salmon. They are facing an “imminent threat of extinction,” according to a statement from the Center for Whale Research. An inadequate amount of action has been invested into re-stabilizing the human caused points of failure. The combined threats have pushed this once thriving iconic clan near extinction.</p>

<h4>Hope remains</h4>
<p>
  Orcas have proven to be resilient when given the opportunity. With your help, we can fight to save them.
</p>
</p>

<h4>Values</h4>
<p>Our coast with healthy, thriving, and abundant resident orcas.</p>

<h4>Our Mission</h4>
<p>The orca project supports building a community centered on ensuring the survival of our brothers and sisters of the Salish Sea. Our purpose is to help fuel a lifelong love for these unique orca.
