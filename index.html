  <h1>About Southern Resident Orca</h1>

    <p>The Southern Resident Orca are immensely social animals and true apex predators of the oceans around the globe. These Residents live in matriarchal society meaning the tracing of kinship is found through the female line. They live almost exclusively in the Salish Sea and are an ancient symbol and modern icon of the Pacific Coast. These orca hold an immensely cultural significance to Indigenous people along the coast.</p>

  <h1> The Orca Project </h1>
    <p>The idea behind this project was born to address the lack of information surrounding the critically endangered Southern Resident Orca population. The population of 72 orca has experienced a significant drop in numbers over the last decade, and these next few years will ultimately determine if they can stabilize enough to survive or continue toward extinction. Our purpose is to help you, help them. </p>

  <h1>How You Can Help </h1>
    <p>With your help, we can take the steps to work together to ensure these ancient family lines live on for future generations to be able to appreciate and respect as we do.</p>
